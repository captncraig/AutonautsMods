# SuperBots

I don't really think the arbitrary limits on bot capabilities are very fun. This mod cheats with the following effects:

1. Bots do not lose energy and do not need recharging.
2. Bots have much increased memory (64/256/1024kb).
3. Bots have dramatically increased range.
4. Bots all scan for items faster.
